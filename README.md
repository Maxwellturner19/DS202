# DS202 Data Science for Social Scientists


# Part 01

The first half of the course focuses on the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms, with an emphasis on supervised learning.

## Lecturer:
Dr. Jon Cardoso-Silva

1. R Programming
2. Data manipulation with dplyr and tidyr
3. Regression - simple and multiple
4. classification - binary and multiple
5. Supervised Learning: Resampling methods - overfitting, resampling, Train-Test Split, Crass-Validation, The Bootstrap, Hyperparameter tuning
6. Supervised Learning: Non-linear algorithms and ensemble methods - Algorithm: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, k-Nearest Neighbours etc.

# Part 02

In the second half of the course, the focus shifts to unsupervised learning.

## Lecturer:

Dr. Ghita Berrada

7. Unsupervised Learning: Introduction and clustering part 1 - k-means and varients 
8. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering part 2 and Anomaly detection - DBSCAN, anomoly detection, density estimation LOF
9. Unsupervised Learning: Dimensionality reduction - PCS, UMAP


# Part 03

Finally, you will be introduced to the basics of text mining, and then we will look at some applications of the algorithms weâ€™ve learned so far.

10. Applications: Text as Data & Topic Modelling
11. Applications: Predictive Modelling on Tabular Data
